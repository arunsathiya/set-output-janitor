This repository is not meant for public use. 

This repository is [@arunsathiya](https://github.com/arunsathiya)'s experiments with the GitHub GraphQL (and REST in a few places) API to automate fixing of `set-output` command usage with `$GITHUB_OUTPUT` as [the former command is deprecated](https://github.blog/changelog/2022-10-11-github-actions-deprecating-save-state-and-set-output-commands/).

Expect code to be brittle, to be written only for Arun's usage and to have bandaid solutions everywhere. I am learning Go's features as I go.
